## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## New Plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = mtcars, 
  mapping = aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
   labs(
    x = "Horsepower", y = "Miles per Gallon (MPG)",
    color = "Cylinders")
```

Based on the graph above, I notice that there is a linear relationship between horsepower and mpg. I also notice that there seems to be a correlation between the number of cylinders and the horsepower of a car. It appears that as the number of cylinders increases, so does the horsepower. It seems that based on the graph, as the number of cylinders increases, the mpg decreases.

## Concluding Thoughts

I found it difficult trying to use ggplot originally because I had to remove and install some packages because of some errors. After refreshing myself on how to use gpplot and layers, it was pretty straight forward. I had to do some extra work to figure out the colors for the cylinders.
